The cafeteria food is getting worse by the day. $15 for a plate of burger and fries does not seem subsidized.

Dear Sir/Madam,
My name is Mateo Gomez and I visited Contoso Restaurant with my spouse for our anniversary on Thursday of last week. Prior to my visit, I had heard great things about your food and service from my neighbors, as I actually live right down the street from you at 1234 Hollywood Boulevard. After a lovely stroll along the Santa Monica Pier, we decided to go for dinner at a place we heard so many good things about. When we got to the restaurant last Thursday, we had to wait for 15 minutes just to get on the waiting list. After an hour of waiting to be seated, we ordered two Surf and turf platters. To our absolute surprise, the food was very cold and dry. The whole experience was just quite awful, and I feel like we are owed a refund and an apology for that day. I would appreciate it if you could call me on my number 949-555-0110.
